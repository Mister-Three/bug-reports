# bug-reports
A simple python project to deal with crashes or bug reports



<h1>How to use:</h1>
<h3>Download the file as a .py or zip, either way all you need in the bugs.py file, Open up whatever you use to edit code (notepad works but you need to turn it into a .txt file) Find the part in the code that says:
webhook = 'INSERT WEBHOOK HERE'
and change the 'INSERT WEBHOOK HERE' to your webhook url, make sure the quotes are there that is important!
close the editor, (turn it back into a .py file if you used notepad) and add it to your code, it could be a copy and paste or a drag and drop, up to you!
